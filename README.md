# TicTacToe

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game made in Java with Swing. My objectives with this are:

- To make it as polished as possible while staying true to the game's rules and spirit.
- To make the architecture as sane as I possibly can (but not forgetting YAGNI and KISS when abstracting).
- To make the game as performant as I can. Of course the difference may never be perceptible, but still fun.

I added a music feature. Try adding songs to the /src/main/resources directory and playing the game.
